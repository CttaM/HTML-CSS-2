    <h1> Have you made pizza from scratch?</h1>
    <h2> Yeah, but have you really thought about it?</h2>
    <h3> Like, how if you put the sauce on first, before you make the base it doesn't work?</h3>
    <h4> Or, if you put the cheese on then the suace it is messed up too.</h4>
    <p1 class="special"> Making pizza is similar to coding. There are certain things we have to do frist. Like making the base, letting it rise, mould the base out, add the sauce, add the toppings, 
        add the cheese, bake, and cut and serve. Not all pizzas end up the same, bnut they do start out in the same way as long as you follow the order correctl. You can everything 
        you need to make many different pizzas using the same base structure that is set up before hand.</p1>
    <h5 class="special"> This is how you make a pizza</h5>
    <p1> <small>There are some specific steps you need to follow to make a pizza, they are listed below</small></p1>
